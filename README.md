# PolyglassAcrylics.github.io
Hello.
This is a Front end website made with html and css.
To run the site, go to this link-(https://harshu1611.github.io/PolyglassAcrylics.github.io/)
Or to run it from your local system, download the zip file and run index.html.
Any improvement suggestions are welcomed.
This is my first basic project, hope you like it.
